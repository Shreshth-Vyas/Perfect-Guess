# Perfect-Guess
Guess the computer number
# 🎯 Perfect-Guess Game

A fun and interactive command-line game built in Python where you try to guess a secret number chosen by the computer!

## 📝 Description

In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100. Your goal is to guess that number in as few attempts as possible. After every guess, the computer will give you a hint to either **"Go Higher"** or **"Go Lower"** until you find the exact match. 

The game also tracks your attempts and will tell you exactly how many turns it took you to win!

## 🚀 Features
* **Randomized Gameplay:** Uses Python's built-in `random` module so the number is different every time you play.
* **Smart Hints:** Provides immediate feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low.
* **Score Tracking:** Counts your total number of guesses to reach the correct answer.
